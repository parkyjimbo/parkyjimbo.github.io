<b>IPTables Lost After Reboot of Head Node</b><br /><br />The iptables were lost every time the machine was rebooted so I found I needed to save the iptabels to a file /etc/iptables.rules.<br />Use the following command to use NAT for the compute nodes <i>sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE</i><br />Then in Ubuntu become <i>su</i> by using <i>sudo su</i> then use the command <i>iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules</i>
