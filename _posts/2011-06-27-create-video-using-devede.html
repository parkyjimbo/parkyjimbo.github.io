<b>DeVeDe</b> is a CD/DVD creator package for Linux. In Ubuntu <i>sudo apt-get install devede</i>, this will install the package.<br />Run the program in Gnome by selecting Applications -> Sound & Video -> DeVeDe CD/DVD Creator.<br />In the program I chose Video DVD. Changed the title by right-clicking on Title. Add the video vob file from the mini DVD source. In the advanced options I chose "<i>FMMpeg deinterlacing filter</i>" as I found that using the default "<i>Don't deinterlace</i>" gave horrible comb effects when the video was playing. The final file created by DeVeDe is an iso file that can be burned on a DVD using K3b.
