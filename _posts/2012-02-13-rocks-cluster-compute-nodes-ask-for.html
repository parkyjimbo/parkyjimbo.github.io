After installing the compute nodes on a new Rocks Cluster it was found that a few nodes kept asking for SSH password. These should have been passwordless SSH and it was working on some of the compute nodes.<br /><br /><bk>Try the following  <i>#rocks sync host sharedkey compute</i>&nbsp;</bk><br /><br /><bk>Try <i>#rocks run host "/opt/rocks/bin/411get --all"</i>&nbsp;</bk><br /><br /><bk>if that works,&nbsp;</bk><br /><br /><bk>Try <i>#rocks sync users</i> on the frontend</bk><br /><br />This cured the password prompt problem on the cluster.
