<b>Ssh-agent Problem</b><br /><br />When I attempted to use the command <i>'ssh-agent'</i>  then the command <i>'ssh-add'</i>  to enter my rsa passphrase and allow me to login to a host without typing my passphrase in all the time. The error I got after entering <i>'ssh-add'</i> was <i>'Could not open a connection to your authentication agent'</i>.<br />The solution was to enter the command <i>'exec ssh-agent bash'</i> the command 'ssh-add' then the passphrase. It worked after this not sure why, it used to work before, could have been an upgrade in Ubuntu 9.10.
