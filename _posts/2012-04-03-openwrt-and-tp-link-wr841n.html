The WR841N has no USB port on the case but USB is available on the PCB if you can solder and don't mind a bit of work to get it going. I had a problem getting the USB connection I made to the WR841N PCB working. I tried various flavours of patched firmware with no success, however on the OpenWRT Forum someone mentioned just use the TP Link MR3420 firmware. This I did and it worked straight away, smiles all round. I then got extroot to a 2GB memory stick working, this allowed me to add more packages. I added a USB hub to allow the connection of a USB webcam.
