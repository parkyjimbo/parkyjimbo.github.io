<b>Using the Temperature sensors on the Motherboard</b><br /><br />The command <i>sensors-detect</i> was used to setup the sensors, then the command <i>sensors</i> was used in a script the output of which was then piped to the cut command to extract the wanted data board temperature was redirected to a data file temp.txt along with a comma to delimit the data. Data collection was performed every 5 minutes this was run in an infinite loop overnight. The data file temp.txt was imported into a spreadsheet as a csv comma separated variable file.<br /><br /><b>The Cheap and nasty Script used</b><br /><br /><i><br />#!/bin/bash<br />while [ 1 ]<br />do<br />temp=`sensors | grep low | grep -v Temp | cut -d\( -f1`<br />echo $temp  >> temp.txt<br />echo , >> temp.txt<br />sleep 300<br />done<br /></i><br /><br />Its not the best script, but it does what I wanted it to do IMHO.<br /><br />....
