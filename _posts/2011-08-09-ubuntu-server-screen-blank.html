<b>Problem when rebooting Ubuntu 11.04 Server X86 after fresh install.</b><br />It caused the screen to be blank and a monitor message of overrange settings. This was traced to the setting of <i>gfxmode=auto</i> in the <i>/boot/grub/grub.cfg</i> file.<br /><br /><b>Note:</b> you have to boot Ubuntu into rescue mode using the media CD/DVD/Memory Stick you used to install the system with. <br />From the command prompt make the<i> /boot/grub/grub.cfg</i> writable using <i>chmod +w /boot/grub/grub.cfg</i> command. <br />Now edit the file using <i>vim /boot/grub/grub.cfg</i> command.<br /><br />The settings that worked for me were as follows <i>gfxmode=1024x768</i> and with an entry <i>gfxplayload=keep</i> added directly after the gfxmode line.<br />After editing hit <i>esc</i> key then type <i>wq</i> and then hit enter this will write the file and quit vim. <br /><br />Now reboot your system and hope it works.<br /><br />What a mucking around to fix this stupid fault.<br /><br /><a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1751950">Information Source I used</a>
