I needed to and Aliases for some IP addresses to the ethernet card on the Rocks Cluster to allow individual nodes to have their own public IP addresses. <br />I created a copy of the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 to ifcfg-eth0:0. This new file was edited with vi to contain <br /><br /><i>DEVICE=eth0:0                                               <br />HWADDR=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx                                  <br />IPADDR=xxx.xxx.xxx.xx                                       <br />NETMASK=255.255.255.0                                     <br />BOOTPROTO=static                                          <br />ONBOOT=yes    </i><br /><br /><i>/sbin/service network restart</i> to update the changes made.<br /><br /><i>/sbin/ifconfig shows the new configuration.</i><br /><br />The change was tested by connecting the node switch to the public 211 subnet and the ip address could be pinged from the subnet showing that the changes were working.<br /><a href="http://www.xenocafe.com/tutorials/linux/redhat/bind_multiple_ip_addresses_to_single_nic/index.php">Info On Binding IP Addresses</a>
