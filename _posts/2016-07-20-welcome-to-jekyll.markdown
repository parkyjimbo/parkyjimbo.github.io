I have set up a couple of NTP Servers on Raspberry Pi's they both use GPS PPS modules to keep time set to within ~uS. I am also logging the offsets to see how accurately time is being kept. The system used for this is [MRTG Multi Router Traffic Grapher][http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/]

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
