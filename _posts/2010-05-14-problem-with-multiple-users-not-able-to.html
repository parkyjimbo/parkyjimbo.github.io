<b>Multiple User Login on Ubuntu</b><br /><br />Problem with multiple users not able to log in to nodes on a cluster. The solution was to copy entries for particular user in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow on the head node to the files on the nodes /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow. Also created the users home directory on each node. This seems to have corrected the problem.
