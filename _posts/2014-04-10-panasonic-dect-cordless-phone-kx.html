This fault was traced to the flexi-circuit from the LCD to the main printed circuit board of the phone. It was bonded in some way to provide the electrical connection and was not soldered. To fix it I cut up a rubber eraser to the correct size the width of the flexi-circuit and a thickness of (1.5mm). This eraser helped to push down on the flexi-circuit when the white LCD housing was clicked onto the PCB. This fixed the fault and the LCD is now as it should be and the contrast adjust also works. Very annoying fault and a result of cheap manufacture not lasting very long.<br />Thanks for reading, I hopes this helps someone.
