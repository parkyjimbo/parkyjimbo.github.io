<h4>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: red;">Remember that using tools can be hazardous so wear eye protection and proceed with caution , if in doubt don't do it.</span></span></h4>I had the annoying problem in that the Pentalobe screws for the Macbook Air I was repairing were too big for the Pentalobe screwdriver I had lying around , it was one supplied in a kit for replacing the LCD on an iPhone. I then realised that the head on this screwdriver has a stretched sort of taper so I basically ground the end of it with a grindstone&nbsp;fitted to my Dremel tool until it fitted the screw-head , testing the fit as I went. Job done , although the modified tool will now no longer fit the iPhone , that's not too much of a problem because iPhone replacement LCD's usually come with the tools required to do the job.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d0n34w0VwoQ/Uuj0SaK7bNI/AAAAAAAABNw/jXAOAXrjAUM/s1600/penta.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d0n34w0VwoQ/Uuj0SaK7bNI/AAAAAAAABNw/jXAOAXrjAUM/s1600/penta.png" height="397" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Ground Down Pentalobe</td></tr></tbody></table>
