A PPC iMac was brought in and it was found that dhcp was not working (it wasn't receiving an IP address from the server).<br /><br />It did work if the IP address was set manually. On further investigation it was found from the system logs that all dhcp requests were being denied. So the firewall was modified to allow dhcp requests and this fixed the problem.
