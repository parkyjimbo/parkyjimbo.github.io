<b>Network Instability</b><br /><br />The cluster had intermittent network availability, sometimes it would accept ssh connections only sometimes. The connections only seemed to last a period of 10 minutes before they were disconnected. <br />It was initailly thought that it may have been something to do with the dhcp server but it turned out that this was not the cause.<br />One of the symptoms was during a ping to the DNS server one would get a few returns then a few Destination Host Unreachable errors. <br />It was eventually traced to having two gateways setup in the <i>'/etc/network/interfaces'</i> one on the public network and one on the private network, when this was corrected to having only one public gateway this fixed the problem.
